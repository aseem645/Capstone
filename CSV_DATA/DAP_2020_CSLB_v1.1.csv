I believe this in part due to his vision/hearing lessening as well as my family's and I being around him almost all the time to 100% of the time.  He developed Lick granuloma on his underbelly this spring because of dermatitis on his back that started a year ago that he can't get to. Weekly medicated baths and a cone seems to be the solution, surprisingly he has not fought either.  He experienced two seizures for the first time in the last 6 mo, both after being bathed and going upstairs shortly afterward. He hates baths and always as. He's always been very energetic after a bath but now he gets carried.   His physical abilities are naturally declining as he ages so he has a ramp now for our tall bed. It took him a few weeks to get used to it but treat training did the trick.   This month to celebrate ten years of Yogi, we went on a hike in the forest at his pace.

She has had(and loved) the same dog food for years. We recently switched to a different kind which she loves and eats more frequently. It like her taste buds have changed.

46919,3,5,"2020-11-04",3,2,3,"""I just want to clarify a couple of things about Magic. 1. When I say she sometimes runs into walls or doors, she's a klutz and is either very into running and rough-housing with our other dog when this happens or on a walk, staring at something (usually a person that has appeared) behind us instead of watching where she is going. 2. When you ask about her urinating or defecating in places she previously kept clean, she is dog who has USMI that is well managed on Proin, but sometimes, if something is very exciting/we're out of our normal routine, she may leak a little bit of urine. She also has been known to defecate inappropriately in the home or my office without rhyme or reason when she is left free-roaming. In my office, she has been much better about this over the past couple of months, but we did have a few incidents over the summer. At home, she is generally crated when we are not home to avoid this, as she does not defecate in her crate. Her preferred inappropriate place is the dining room rug, although last week, we found a single piece of stool on the living room rug, which may or may have appeared during a brief time of freedom or maybe while we were otherwise occupied elsewhere in the home. She has never had a """"schedule"""" for her bowel movements and may go anywhere from not at all (which happens rarely) to 5 times in a single day. I do not have a good explanation for when or why she will have a bowel movement in the house/office. I will say that the dining room is one of our two least-used rooms in the home. Generally, Magic is a good problem solver and much more of an independent thinker than our other dog. She is good at retrieving her own toys if they roll under a couch or table or will persist at trying to get a piece of food out of a corner or under a piece of furniture if one goes astray (our other dog may make a weak attempt and then looks to us or will just stare at the location of whatever he wants). If we're playing a new game with her, she is fairly quick to pick up most of them and remembers the game quickly if we do not play for a while. She is more receptive to petting or physically contacting us while she sits with us on the couch now than she was 6 months ago. Sometimes, she's more cat-like than dog-like with the attention and affection she wants. She always wants to have a visual on us, but not necessarily interact directly. (She will often lay on the landing if one of us is upstairs and the other downstairs. If we're on one couch, she generally prefers to be on the other. She often gets up and moves to the other end of the couch if one of us sits next to her or gets up entirely.) When she wants attention, however, she will shove her head under your hand repeatedly. She full-body wags when we get home. She often used to growl at us if we went to physically touch her, and she wasn't in the mood for it. I don't believe either of us has elicited this response from her in several months, and she often voluntarily jumps between us and puts her head in one of our laps while we're watching t.v. I think that about sums up Magic's behavioral ticks.""",1,3,1,3,40,1,3,1,2

I set up a """"blanket fort"""" with a table on the porch and insulation/walls on 4 sides so he has shelter from the wind.  He does seem to have a good appetite.  He's started going in the closet and accidentally closing the door and trapping himself in the laundry room, something he didn't do very often until recently.  He can open doors and doorknobs if he can push, so he often opens the door to the basement while I am out, in case he has to go potty   (he annoyingly decides downstairs-- an unfinished basement-- is the least injurious place, which is sort of accurate, but now he hasn't had an accident for months.). I lock the door when I go in case he gets a mind to go out.  He can't open the storm door handle so he's done damage to the storm door.  (He's smart.)   However, his kitchen sound alerting is iffy-- he goes through cycles,  and he keeps coming up and looking to the door when I am working in the kitchen. I habitually send him out  when I am cooking (and he likes it because he knows I will check on him and bring him in-- I can't hear him)  but it really looks like he thinks he hears the banging and all that outside from the wind.  I point the source of noise out to him and he's still """"I want the door.""""  So I'm a bit concerned one ear may be off, but right now he doesn't smell like he has an ear infection.   Six months ago... well, the pandemic means we both go out much less, and the increased UV-A this spring (ozone layer thinned from polar vortex) has created more sun-related symptoms for me, so I've been restricting my outside time during daylight hours.  I worry he's bored and a little depressed.

After that he didn't want to go for a walk after dusk, but would go in the morning or early afternoon. Soon after that fireworks started for 4th of July (people set off a fireworks at their homes in 2020 due to Covid boredom). Because Bruce hates loud noises like fireworks and thunder, he started refusing to go for walks at all, regardless of time of day (that was my guess). Throughout November, he has started getting much better about going for walks, even occasionally going after it gets dark, but sometimes will still refuse. For example yesterday I tried to take him around 1pm when it was still plenty light, he acted excited to go but when we went out he turned around multiple times, eventually returning home after only 15 minutes of walking (as compared to an hour or so of walking on good days).

He would leave the room or move to the floor if we were on the couch or move to the couch if we were on the floor to get away from us. Anytime the toddler made a loud noise like a squeal or giggle Tyson would freeze and stare with a stiff tail and perky ears. He would huff in irritation and wanted nothing to do with an adult if they were holding the toddler. Not even for treats. And Tyson doesn't turn down treats. Ever. He was very unsure of the little human's unpredictable behaviors. In the last six months, Tyson has grown accustomed to my toddler being increasingly active. Tyson is longer phased by the activity and will nap in the middle of the floor while toys and balls fly over him and sometimes even land on him. Tyson will separate his toys from the toddler's toys when they get mixed up. He will even pick up some small toys and put them in the play pen when the toddler throws them out. He does that on his own. He wasn't taught to do it. He keeps a watchful eye on the toddler when the two other dogs we have are being rowdy in the toddlers vicinity. I've even seen him get up from his comfy spot on the couch and put himself in between the toddler and the other dogs like a protective shield. He went from being uneasy about the little human moving around to being a protector and overall pretty chill in the middle of the chaos. It's been fun to watch Tyson figure out the toddlers's behavior and get over his apprehension. He lets the toddler pet him and lay on him while he's napping. He knows the difference between the toddlers loud noises now too. He can tell if it's distress or playful and he reacts accordingly. Very cool to see. ",3,3,1,3,40,5,3,1,1

He was more active and slept less once he started the antibiotics, but in general the infection seemed to have taken a lot out of him.

The first six months she grew 60 pounds and some months she was putting on 12 pounds a month... all body growth, not much brain/skull (tiny little head on a huge body for way too long). Only after she stopped growing did her brain and head size finally catch up, so now I have a 75 pound golden with the cognitive and emotional capacity of a 6 month old puppy. She hated to snuggle or be held as a pup, was supremely confident about life and wouldn't listen to people or respond to affection as a reward (although she is almost the fastest pup I've housetrained - she had the coordination to use the dog door and do stairs at 10 weeks and preferred to use grass for her business - so she did.) She's not dumb at all, but for a golden retriever, her affinity to humans took a while to show up. Now she is bold, a playful thief, sometimes with wild energy and very physical play (esp with my other golden), very busy energy, but she uses her talk buttons to ask for dinner and carrots, knows some toys by name, brings every bone in the house to lay and chew at my feet while I watch tv (one at a time, chews it for 2-3 minutes and then goes to get another one), and choose to cuddle on the couch and sleeps on the bed with me at night.

Now, he comes to where I am and barks a time or two when he needs to go out, which I believe is an adaptive behavior, on his part, due to his blindness. He is currently age 14+ and will turn 15 this coming Spring. He sometimes has a little difficulty finding food dropped on the floor as he must entirely rely upon his nose, although he always locates food that either he or I have dropped onto the floor within a few seconds by using his highly efficient and perceptive hound nose. While he still runs eagerly to the door to greet me or to go outside or for a ride, he sleeps VERY soundly and for much longer at a time these days. He can still hear well, it seems, and will rouse from sleep (eventually) when I call his name and will still come when called when he is out in the yard as he has always done, on his terms. He will turn his head toward the sound of my voice, but may or may not come immediately.  For the past approximately 3 years, he has needed to be on anti-seizure medicine and also takes medicine to control the essential tremors he began having in his hind legs and his jaw about 2 years ago.

He seems to pause a bit longer and assess before reacting or deciding what to do next when in situations that increase his anxiety.   Every day no longer seem to start over as Day 1 for him as a rescue dog. He knows our typical work-week versus weekend routines and is much more able to be go with the flow, even when the typical days change (e.g. when my partner's son is staying in our household versus his moms', or if we go to work late, etc.). He shows much less anxiety and waits to see what is going to happen. Looks for cues and/or recognizes words we use to let him know what's coming next, e.g. """"Hunter will be here soon"""", """"going out for a bit"""", etc.   Most significantly than anything above, he shows much more trust in my partner, Jeff, and Jeff's 15 yr old son, Hunter, in the last 6 months. He seems to have finally realized they are simply all-good to handle him with putting on a collar/leash, reaching out/over to pet him, putting their face down to his to give him attention, give him verbal correction, etc. This has been a major step forward.    Finn has also become more protective of ALL members of the household, including the 6-month old puppy that we adopted 4 months ago. He knows he's not the one in charge of the household and will listen to to most commands if given correction, esp. from me, but I think he now is very comfortable with """"his pack"""" and quite comfortable in doing so unless told to do otherwise.""",3,1,2,1,25,1,1,1,3

To be fair, a number of other changes were introduced around the same time....2 new doggy doors were installed and he had to learn to use them and his """"living room bed"""" was moved slightly to make room for Christmas decorations.    Eventually, we found a new food that he decided he liked and he loves his new freedom to come in and out as he pleased.  This is our first Newfoundland (we've had labs in the past) and his temperament and thinking is much different than the labs.  He seems to be more sensitive to change and has no problem communicating his issues.  Besides the refusal to eat, he took up howling for about 2 week during this period.

It is harder for her to get up from a lying position and she has taken to barking when she is left alone in a room, rather than getting up to come join where people are.  We have placed yoga mats around on hardwood floors to improve her footing.  She seems to bark more often, and has always avoided letting strangers pet her without a lot of coaxing and reassurance first, but that is getting a bit worse. She seems happy and her usual friendly, and is very food motivated, but spends alot more time just lying around. When we walk her, she cannot go nearly as far without getting winded or slowing way down.  She seems to have increasing separation anxiety, but can also go long periods being calm and quiet.

For example, I work in the backroom next to the dog door and every time he comes in from outside he will always come over and get pet before heading off wherever. However, if I stand up or go after him he will run and grab whatever's in reach (hopefully 1 of his 30+ toys) and try to get me to chase him. The same goes with anybody coming into the house that he knows. He won't come over for pets he will grab something, wiggle, and hop in and out of that person's reach trying to get them to chase. Then he will bring over a chew and get the person to hold it for him. Miles was not a fast learner other than potty training.

For example, now she readily trots to her mat, turns around and lays down when she wants to receive a tasty treat. We have shaped her behavior so that she must have all 4 paws on the mat, and she now corrects herself (sometimes we help with an """"OOPS!) to get every paw on the mat. Interestingly, she applies """"go to your mat"""" to any rug/bed/small defined area that we point to. Also, she applies those same principles to our front porch, (go to the porch!) and one time she was going to step off the porch, and as she started to put her paws on the ground, I shouted a quick """"OOPS!"""" and she tucked her legs back and got herself so quickly back onto the porch, just like a little kid who might get in trouble.    My main point is that we see her apply this principle of being or staying in one small, defined area (go to your mat- a small foot rug by the door) to other areas. her dog bed, the front porch, the mat by the front door, the rug on the front and back porch, etc. The training has really paid off in that regard.

It took about 3 days before he got it without my intervening. This is much slower processing than he's shown over the previous years.

He and Sparky had gotten into spats before, but once this started, Willy really seemed to want to kill him. We had to keep them in separate areas of the house.  Willy has become a completely different dog since Sparky died. He hasn't offered to bite anyone since and, believe me, that's amazing! In all the 11 years the two dogs lived together with us, neither of them ever learned to ask to go outdoors to pee. The day after Sparky's death, Willy suddenly started asking to go out, and accidents now are rare.

He must have been out there alone for a while because he was very emaciated and one giant skin infection from demodex when he was found. His body condition score was 1. Once he got healthy, he did well emotionally for awhile but over time he seemed to get worse. All of a sudden he was afraid of thunder, where he hadn't been before. Certain sounds would really seem to traumatize him, others that I thought would, didn't. Anyway, In the last 6 months his sensitivity to sound has gotten worse and the terror he feels from it can last for a very long time (Months). It seems like a panic attack or PTSD, and the feelings that were triggered seem to linger for a very long time. At the end of September He heard gunshots (or something that sounded like gunshots) that seemed to be pretty close. He was so terrified it broke my heart. He clearly panicked, and he would have fled if he could have. He's been traumatized ever since. He had been doing well when practicing his bravery before this happened. After that event we had to start over on trying to work on his bravery. He wouldn't step out of the garage at first. It's taken six weeks to get him to walk up and down our street.  I think he will be better able to be out in the world for longer periods of time if we keep just doing baby steps and if there are no more scary sounds . But since you can't always predict sounds, it will likely happen again. Poor guy.",1,3,1,3,36,2,3,1,1

He is next to me all day long, sleeping, and is quite content, but after dinner time, if I'm not holding him, even if he's right near me, he warbles a soft vocal yodel - it sounds as though he is distraught.   He has recently started not finding the door to go outside or out of a room. He knows he's in the right area but will be in the corner anxiously waiting for the door to open where it hinges. Once he is guiding by the open door and realizes he is in the corner, he finds his way out. Occasionally he bumps into things or cannot make it up the small half step into the house. He will run into it as if his legs didn't do what they were supposed to.  He increasingly doesn't like eating at 8 am when he wakes up. I am often up before he is and need to wake him up. (he sleeps in my bed under the covers). The harder it is to wake him up, the less likely he is to eat that morning. He goes out, does potty, usually, and then goes through the food routine with my other two dogs - I make them sit before eating - Jack has decided he doesn't need to sit, so he stands and then walks over to his bowl - he then sniffs his food, stands in front of it for a bit, and then walks away. (Fromm's dry kibble with Grizzly Salmon oil and warm water). After his morning nap, he is ready to go out and then eat - usually around 10:30a -11a. In the evening, he gets a Tbsp of Nulo wet food on his kibble and does not miss a meal.   Increasingly he has been peeing in the house. He can just have been outside, and then 30 minutes later, be right next to me and go potty (usually when I am occupied doing something else). Luckily his urine and feces have little smell - I think because he eats healthy.   My father thinks he doesn't always see or recognize him, but I have not observed that behavior. I think there is a vision issue possibly, but he can be sound asleep and know I've left the room, showing up behind me shortly thereafter.    """,5,4,3,3,55,4,4,4,3

His behavior in these episodes is very unusual.  His usual behavior is to be close by or snuggle peacefully.  He is not normally clingy, restless, and anxious.  """,2,3,1,3,35,1,3,1,1

I'll finish with the outdoor Chloe (I walk her and let her out into our fenced in city lot which is 37 1/2 feet wide by 150 feet long).    Chloe is no longer affectionate. She never wants to cuddle. She either doesn't want to obey or she doesn't understand the command. She is almost completely deaf. She still responds to hand signals most of the time for Sit & Down but only occasionally for Come. Chloe's on pain medication (rimadyl) but it isn't completely effective. She has always had the """"shakes"""" on and off, but she shakes more than previously. She isn't as happy as she used to be. Her tail was always up and now it's often curled under. She still plays but not much. She always caught the ball (or stuffed animal) and always brought it back for another throw. Now she seems confused and doesn't really know what to do with it. Chloe doesn't really know how to play anymore. Sometimes she still gets excited and races back and forth in the house which is great. She hasn't lost all her mojo.   When she's outside in the yard she has a routine that she has done for years. She checks the complete perimeter of the yard, pretty much in the same pattern depending on if she let out the front or the back door. There are many birds, squirrels and rats in the yard. Plus an occasional faction, opossum, or rabbit. She just killed her 49th rat last week. She was alone in the backyard  . I took the garbage out and as I walked by her she was exhibiting an indoor behavior that I haven't seen her do outside. She was just staring at our building's  brick wall. She's always very active outside. Even if it's only walking  around and smelling everything. When I returned from my trip to the garage there was a dead rat right where she had been standing. It had the bruised back and fresh blood on its ear. She always has shaken the prey until it stops steeling and then drops it and walks away. She has in the passed, if we weren't present for the kill, brought the kill over to us and dropped at our feet and then just walked away. Our garbage cans are kept in a cared area next to our garage and neat the alley many kills have happened in this area over the years when she is outside and I am within her sight she'll stand at the gate and look back at me to see if I'm coming to open the gate. But now when I let her into that rather large area that she use to completely explore, she'll just run to the furthest point and then turn around and run passed me back into the yard as I'm still standing at the gate. It's like a routine she has to do as part of her outdoor mission.  When we go for a walk it's to the park directly across our street.  I used to walk her on heel, off leash for years. She would play fetch returning the ball as fast as she chased it and the opening her mouth releasing the ball as she made a U-turn and the ball would roll forward to my feet. I would field it and could barely out throw her as she fielded it and ran back repeating the process for throw after throw. Now she has almost no interest in the ball at all. Because of her lack of hearing, everything she does revolves around smelling. About six months ago she might return the ball two or three times before being distracted by some smell. She'd drop the ball wherever she was and not return it at all over those months her fetch instincts have completely disappeared. She won't chase the ball anymore. There is a fenced in dog park in the main park. We used to play fetch in there also. In the summer I set up a wading pool for the use of the dogs a hose was attached to the side of the pool near the top of the sidewall and a drain was placed near the bottom of the sidewalk 180 degrees away. The hose was outfitted with a shut off valve and a quick release mechanism. If we were there alone or with just a dog or two with their owners I would release the hose and cast the water onto the asphalt pavement, into the pool, out of the pool on the other side, back into the pool, out of the pool and on and on and on. Meanwhile, Chloe would be hot on the hunt chasing the water jumping into and out of the pond. She had lost interest by the end of thi summer after about seven years of thi activity. She was never very interested in the other dogs or people but liked some of both and tolerated the others. The last couple of times I took her into the fenced in area she stood by the gate trying to leave on her own when other people came in. She eventually learned to squeeze her way through the wrought iron fencing that surrounds the enclosure. After escaping twice into the larger park area I stopped bringing her into the dog park. We have a routine. I walk der on leash until we come to the dog park fence and then I let her off leash and she walks in the """"parkway"""", a grassy area between the public sidewalk and the street. She sniffs, pees, sniffs, pees, sniffs, eventually poops and continues to sniff. She walks in the parkway at her own pace and I walk on the sidewalk for about 1000 feet. We the renter the park and she sniffs her way around one side of the park about 2000 feet and then when I catch her eye I lift my hand and she'll sit. I'll put her on leash and walk her home. She can here a loud clap but doesn't always obey the following waving come command. """,5,5,2,4,57,5,5,1,2

71106,3,3,"2020-11-09",3,1,3,"I haven't noticed much change in the last 6 months. Hazel is almost 10 years old and the change she has undergone compared to her first 6 years or so is dramatic, but it is linked to a single event. She used to be extremely driven - running along a loping horse or covering 10+ miles barely dampened her energy. She was destructive if there wasn't an outlet for her energy. She liked to keep to herself - a short pet and some attention for 5 minutes and she'd run off again. She began slowing down in 2017 as my older dog got a tumor and began to deteriorate. He declined steadily and I put him down in September of 2018. As he declined, I chose to spend quality time with him and Hazel got a lot less exercise so we wouldn't have to leave him behind alone which caused him distress. And she settled into it readily. After his death, Hazel's personality changed - she was afraid to run out by herself and was depressed and subdued, while also becoming clingy. Now she wanted to have a lot of contact with me and seeking out frequent petting and touching. After 2 months, I adopted a rescue dog (approx 5 year-old Husky-Great Pyrenees mix). They are attached to each other, but they are not inclined to seek each other out for contact.

Roo hates rain, (his least favorite thing in the whole world). He has little to no hair coat so chills quickly if wet and cold out. Also does not appreciate coat to help him retain body heat. When seriously raining, not just mist or drizzle he has to wear coat and leash in order to be forced outside for routine outings. I am always with them. This morning sunny, 43 degrees, walked to river, ground wet and muddy with puddles (no dog coats or leashes).  He is wearing no-barking collar during the day, off in evening and all night. Beeps and vibrates if barking continues. He never gets to the vibrate stage. Barking at every sound, phone ringing or using phone to call out or entrance by family member is hugely improved.

I suspect there are two contributing factors to this change in behavior. The biggest contributing factor, I believe, is a psychological one: my boyfriend moved in with us about 8 months ago, and considering that she has never in her life had another long term """"roommate"""" besides me, she was initially subdued by his presence. However, now that she's fallen in love with him and considers him a member of the pack, her silly behaviors have increased alongside her audience size. I believe she's much more confident in her level of derp because she knows she's got a captivated audience that feeds off/responds to it. If there is a second factor to this change in behavior, I believe it is a physiological one: Mia recently had dental surgery where several teeth were removed and it's possible her playful behavior is also a result of experiencing less pain on a daily basis.

With the virus now ~9 months in, Wylie has received even more attention and exercise, all good for his cognition.  He is also off leash for 'squirrel patrol' in the park, hiking trails, or on the beach at least 1-2 Xs/day.   He also likes to wrestle and socialize with the neighbors dogs too.  This is his *favorite time of the day,* when he is interacting, wrestling, socializing, or sprinting and chasing squirrels around trees [even though he has never come close to catching one].   I trust him off leash and he is also lucky because we have a fenced in yard where he is also outside many hours each day.   He greets everyone who walks by the fence and brings people his toys (and tries to get people to play with him).

As I recuperated, my wife would take over the last part of the process, but now I am able to do it again. For the first several days, Chloe was confused, first didn't leave the kitchen, then would go to the bedroom and jump into our bed (where she is allowed when prompted), and then go to her crate when prompted a second or third time. After a few nights, she seemed to relearn her original behavior and sprint to her own bed. Other than that, have not noticed any changes over the past 6 months and much longer.

In terms of changes in thinking, it's clear she is paying attention to the amount of attention he gets and asks for similar attention. For example, when he's being brushed or groomed, she will come and stand nearby to wait her turn to be brushed or clipped, too. Prior to his arrival, she was never brushed or groomed in this way because her fur doesn't require that type of maintenance.  This is a consistent behavior now for her that we have to give her a brief brushing and pretend to clip her hair if he gets this treatment.  Another example of changes in thinking is that when it's feeding time, in order for the Labradoodle to be allowed to eat, he has to sit and wait for a hand signal that tells him he can eat. Lately, she now does the same thing even though this has never been required of her. Prior to his arrival, she was free fed.

He is very alert about people passing by or approaching the house and let's us know with a low growl, which will progress to a bark if we don't respond and the people or dog gets too close. He's good on a leash, but in the beginning of the walk he wants to pee on every bush for the first five minutes, but then he's good.   The one thing he does do is get very excited about shadows or reflections of light on the floor or walls.  He absolutely loves them and knows they happen around 5:00 pm. Reflections of light, or light spots from a beam, can instantly distract him from everything else and he goes wild trying to chase it down.    Mark is aware that if I turn on the ceiling fan or use the fan remote, that it causes the ceiling fan to turn on. So when he sees me reach for the switch or remote, he looks up at the fan. This is just one example of that. Mark understand cause and effect. Another example is when he was less than a year old, he hated cats. In order to keep him we had to do some extensive training so he wouldn't kill our cats. We took him to a trainer who used a mild shock collar on him (this is the only thing we've ever used this training method for), and even if I hid the collar remote behind my back so he couldn't see me use it, he knew it was me. If he was going for the cat and he felt the shock, he would turn and stare at me, everytime. He's basically fine with cats now, but you can tell he'd love to go after them if he thought it was a good idea, although strange cats should not come into our yard.",1,3,1,3,34,1,3,1,1

Then I had to home school 4 kids and we had to isolate our family. The trainings stopped and I'm still concerned with taking Pegasus out for walks. We started going out again when the kids went back to school in August. It was great, then Covid cases started increasing again and then I read an article on how people that walk their dogs are like 70% chances on catching Covid. That scare us again and we stopped the walks again. We have a big yard, so he does get plenty of exercise daily, but his lack of dog socializing is affecting him. I wish there was no Covid and I can take him to doggie parks. He barks at the neighboring dogs when then walk by the house. I know he wishes to play. He is starting to bark at the kids and neighbors that pass by too. I used to take him to the bus stop and all the neighbors and kids will let him and he loved it. None of the neighbors have touch him since March. But he gets plenty of love from our family of 6, but I wish he could socialize more. I can't wait for Covid to be over.
